This repo is part of my diploma @ BSU FAMCS.

This script attempts to approximate the solution of the Drift Diffusion model for a 1D pn-junction diode.
The method for solving this BVP was described by DeMari in the "AN ACCURATE NUMERICAL STEADY-STATE ONE-
DIMENSIONAL SOLUTION OF THE P-N JUNCTION" paper.
However, the generic method, though fairly simple, did not provide good results for applied voltage a couple volts away from zero.
